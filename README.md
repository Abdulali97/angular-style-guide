# Angular Style Guide by Angular Space x Angular Space Mentors - powered by community :)

An **opinionated Angular Style Guide + Best Coding Practices**. Built collaboratively with Angular Space & Angular Space Mentors, this guide is created for the community by the community! Like our articles, this guide aims for high quality and remains open to community contributions and feedback. *(Work in Progress)*

Before launching this project, I reached out to the community on social media, and the response was overwhelmingly positive! This guide is going to be designed to help teams make thoughtful choices on Angular styles and practices, tailored to fit various projects, teams, and architectural preferences. We are going to rpovide the thought process needed to make informed decisons BUT we will have out strong recommendations and when they FIT.

### In this guide, you'll find:
- **Guidance on making informed style choices**, with explanations of recommended options, when they work best, and cases where they may not fit as well.
- A focus on understanding the **thought process** behind style selection, making it adaptable rather than prescriptive.
- **Regular alignment with official Angular updates**, while keeping flexibility at the core to support evolving best practices.

Thank you for your enthusiasm and feedback in making this happen â€“ let's build a guide that grows with the Angular community!
